horizon;description
O horizon;The organic or litter layer mainly over the soil surface composed of fresh and decaying plant residue. Typically composed of >25% organic soil materials.  This layer can usually be easily brushed away by hand.
A horizon;This is the top layer of soil (often called top soil) that typically has the highest microbial activity.  It is composed of a mixture of mineral material and accumulated humified organic matter. Also, any plowed or disturbed surface layer.
E horizon;This is the eluviated layer that is only seen in older soils and is not a universally used horizon designation.  If present it is below the A horizon and commonly is recognized by its lighter colored due to loss of clay, iron, aluminum, organic matter or some combination of these components. 
B horizon;In lay terms this is often called sub-soil.  It is the layer where most of the mineral materials that leach from the upper horizons accumulate.  Accumulation of clay, iron, silica, calcium carbonate, calcium sulphate, sesquioxides, and/or humus can occur.  Soil structure and color often differs from the A horizon. Color may be redder or browner due to iron accumulation.  Structure may be more granular, prismatic, or blocky. 
C horizon;This is basically the weathered parent rock (excluding hard bedrock) that has not been affected by soil formation.  Composed mainly of large rocks. 
R layer;This is the consolidated unweathered hard bedrock beneath the soil.  Usually is one large continuous rock mass.  The bedrock commonly found below the C horizon but under certain circumstances can be found directly below the A or B horizon.
Permafrost;Soils that are permanently frozen due to sustained temperature of less than 0ÂºC for two or more years.  Typically found in Polar regions.
