                <h3>
                Of the estimated 10 million species that exist on our planet, only just over a million have so far been identified and described.
                </h3>

                <p>
                Using traditional taxonomy, it would take at least another 2000
                years to identify Earth’s remaining species. With DNA
                barcoding, we can vastly accelerate this rate of biodiversity
                discovery and conservation as well as generate significant
                scientific and economic benefits for the mining, fisheries and
                forestry industries.
                </p>

                The national collaborative project will focus on five key areas with immediate strategic value:
                <ul>
                    <li> verifying timber origins to combat illegal timber trading </li>
                    <li> authenticating labelling and geographical origin of fish in the retail marketplace </li>
                    <li> mapping plant biodiversity in the Pilbara to help with mine site environmental impact assessment and restoration management </li>
                    <li> biodiversity discovery and impact assessment of invertebrates that inhabit underground aquifers utilised by mining and farming</li>
                    <li> generating barcodes for Australia’s orchids to enhance conservation. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <!--

                    The project is led by Professor Andrew Lowe from the
                    University of Adelaide in a partnership with scientists from
                    Kings Park Botanic Garden, CSIRO, Australian Tropical
                    Herbarium, the South Australian Museum, ARC Centre of
                    Excellence in Plant Energy Biology and WA Department of Parks
                    and Wildlife. Bioplatforms Australia is managing the project
                    and will provide access to DNA sequencing infrastructure and
                    genomics and bioinformatics expertise.
